Hey!

Provided In my repo is a ton of stuff I have made over the years.
Feel free to screw around and use anything as you please.
(except for training AI)

Please note: some materials could contain unintentionally copyrighted works
such as a logo in the background of a photo. 

I hope my lack of skills can help others create cool stuff,
I look forward to seeing what anyone comes up with.

If you would like to share something with me, tag me on instagram @grantersg
or shoot me an email grantersgbusiness@gmail.com
